# Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Analysis | MM/YY | [Your GitHub/Portfolio Link] | [Demo Link]

## Project Overview
In this hypothetical student project, I conducted an analysis of Airbnb listings in Manhattan to provide insights for a client looking to invest in vacation rental properties. The goal was to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes, and to assess the rental income potential of different property types. This project utilized Airbnb data to answer key business questions and provide data-driven recommendations for investment opportunities.

## Analysis Questions
The client wanted to understand the following:
1. **Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e., number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?**
2. **How much money did these most attractive listings generate?**
3. **Do different neighborhoods have different preferences for property sizes?**

## Key Findings
- **Most Attractive Neighborhoods for Vacation Rentals**: By analyzing rental frequencies (based on review counts), I identified the top neighborhoods in Manhattan where Airbnb properties are most frequently rented. These neighborhoods had high occupancy rates, making them prime areas for investment.
  
- **Most Popular Property Sizes**: I analyzed the number of bedrooms in each property to determine the most popular sizes for vacation rentals. The findings showed that certain property sizes, such as 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom units, were more frequently rented compared to others.
  
- **Neighborhood Preferences for Property Sizes**: Using pivot tables, I explored whether different neighborhoods had different preferences for property sizes. The analysis revealed patterns in how specific areas favored certain property types, allowing for targeted investment recommendations.

- **Rental Income Potential**: I assessed how much money the most attractive listings generated by looking at the total revenue based on the number of reviews and the average rental prices. This helped quantify the financial attractiveness of different property types and neighborhoods.

## Data Used
- **Airbnb Listings Data**: Contains information about the properties such as neighborhood, number of bedrooms, price, review counts, and other relevant details.
  
## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the data by handling missing values and ensuring consistent formats across key columns like price, neighborhood, and review counts.
2. **Pivot Table Analysis**: Created pivot tables to analyze neighborhood popularity, property sizes, and rental frequencies.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualized the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes using bar charts and scatter plots to better communicate insights.
4. **Financial Analysis**: Calculated revenue generation by multiplying the average price per night by the number of reviews (as a proxy for rental frequency) to estimate income potential for various property types.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Google Sheets/Excel**: Used pivot tables, filtering, and various functions to analyze the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Used bar charts and scatter plots to represent the most attractive property sizes and neighborhoods.
- **Spreadsheet Functions**: Utilized functions such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, and `VLOOKUP` to clean and analyze the dataset.

## Recommendations for Investment
- **Top Neighborhoods for Investment**: Focus on areas with the highest rental frequencies, as these locations are most likely to provide a steady stream of income.
- **Property Size Preferences**: 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom units are generally the most popular, and investing in these sizes may yield higher returns.
- **Tailored Investment Strategy**: Based on neighborhood and property size preferences, the client should consider diversifying investments to cater to both solo travelers and families, depending on the location.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the Manhattan vacation rental market, identifying attractive neighborhoods and property sizes, and estimating their rental income potential. These insights will guide the client in making informed investment decisions, maximizing returns, and targeting the right property types for their Airbnb business.
