## Project Requirements

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Find the number of taxi rides for each taxi company for November 15-16, 2017.
   - Identify the number of rides for companies with "Yellow" or "Blue" in the name for November 1-7, 2017.
   - Aggregate ride data for popular taxi companies (Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services) and group other companies as "Other."

2. **Weather Impact Analysis on Ride Duration**  
   - Retrieve neighborhood identifiers for the Loop and O'Hare International Airport.
   - Classify weather conditions as "Bad" (rain or storm) or "Good" for each hour using the weather data.
   - Analyze the duration of rides between the Loop and O'Hare on rainy Saturdays versus other weather conditions.

3. **SQL Queries and Data Aggregation**  
   - Use SQL JOIN operations to connect `trips` and `weather_records` tables based on timestamps.
   - Perform necessary aggregations (e.g., GROUP BY, CASE) to categorize and analyze the data.
