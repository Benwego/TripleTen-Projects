## Key Findings


1. **Sales Trends by Month**:
   - Winter months (November to January) were the most active months, likely due to cold weather conditions that drive customers to use the app for convenience.


2. **Peak Sales Year**:
   - The highest sales occurred in 2018, with a dramatic drop in 2020, likely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.


3. **Sales by Occupation**:
   - Students represented the largest consumer group by volume, but employees contributed more to overall revenue.


4. **Purchasing Patterns**:
   - Employees purchased over 14,000 items, making them the largest contributors to the quantity of items sold.
   - However, employees also generated more than $1M in sales, making them the highest revenue-generating group, despite students purchasing in higher quantities.
